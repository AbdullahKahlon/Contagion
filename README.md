# Tutorial
Open Contagion.py in IDLE and run it to play. <br /> 
The goal of the game is to infect and kill the population of earth with your highly unstable virus <br /> 
You are racing against the cure percentage, because if cure percentage reaches 100 then a vaccine <br /> 
for your virus has been developed and you lose the game. <br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
## Controls
The infect button on the bottom left grants you infections and points for every click <br /> 
<br /> 
You also earn infections and points passively every tick, the speed of which can be upgraded with <br /> 
the tick speed upgrade. <br /> 
<br /> 
The first column of upgrade buttons increase the infectivity of your virus, increasing the amount <br /> 
of infections you earn per tick/click <br /> 
<br /> 
The second column of upgrades increases the lethality of your virus, increasing the rate at which <br /> 
it kills infected people. <br /> 
<br /> 
Cure resistance slows down the progress of the vaccine, reducing cure percentage. <br /> 
<br /> 
Mutation rate increases the likelihood of your virus randomly mutating, which can grant upgrades, <br /> 
infections, and points <br /> 
<br /> 
Good luck beating the current record of fastest win, which belongs to Tai poole who was able to <br /> 
wipe out the entire population in 168 days <br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
# Tips
Points scale with infections but scale even higer with lethality, so if you feel like you are <br /> 
earning points too slowly buy lethality and infectivity upgrades <br /> 
<br /> 
There are many ways you can strategize and customize your disease to get the fastest win, but the <br /> 
current best strategy is to focus on buying infectivity upgrades early game until you can start <br /> 
maxing mutation chance, and letting random mutations carry you to late game.
