Variables, population, dead pop, infected pop, alive pop, lethality, infectivity, cure progress, mutation chance, upgrade cost for each upgrade, tick speed, days passed, points, infections per point, current date

Dictionary:
  3 dictionaries for the 3 types of upgrades, infectivity, lethality and misc. keys are the names of the specific upgrade, value is the tier of the upgrade.  
 
def click:
  when button clicked, 
  add <lethality> number of infections to infected population
  add 1/infections per point to points. Maybe add some scaling with cure?
  configure the buttons to display the correct information of points and infections
  
def passive:
  passive, runs every tick rate. 
  check for win or lose condition. If win, make dead population = starting population and make everything else zero. Go to end game win screen
  if lose, go to lose end game screen 
  
  win screen will display congrats message and how many days it took
  lose screen will display loss message.
  
  dayspassed += 1
  
  add x number of infections to infected population
  add 1/infections per point to points
  configure the buttons to display the correct information of date, points, and infections
  
  configure any other buttons since when upgrading might not update the button to the right cost value
  
  mutatecheck, if rolls a number less than the mutation chance runs the mutation command
  
def mutate:
  run another random number generator, between 1 and 11 9 for each upgrade and 2 for random number of points and infections
  
  if run 1 than give points
  if 2 than give infections
  if 3-11 than run corresponding upgrade function but add the points cost to points first
 
  
def lethal upgrades:
  if have enough points to upgrade than upgrade 
  subtract cost from points
  lethality *= x
  cost *= x
  
  if value of key = max than lock the button and make no command and replace cost with maxed
  
repeat function 3 times for the three upgrades

  
def infectious upgrades:
  if have enough points to upgrade then run function
  subtract cost amount of points
  infectivity *=
  cost *=
  infections per point += 
  configure points button
  
  if value of key = max than lock the button to no command and replace cost text with maxed
 
repeat three times for the three types of upgrades

  
def misc upgrades:
  if have enough points to upgrade than run function
  decrease tick rate, 
  increase mutation rate
  or decrease the cure percentage
  

create window
adjust pixels and title, make not resizeable


create widgets, labels for all the upgrades, title, infections, infections per day, deaths per day, population alive, unaffected, date, points, cure progress, lethality, all different colours and fonts

create a 3x3 grid of buttons for the upgrades and the infect click button in the corner which is the logo
